## Tasks

### 0. Debugging - Python Factorial
**Objective**: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.

### Issue:
The code doesn't calculate the factorial correctly due to an infinite loop in the `factorial` function.

#### Fix:
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    while n > 1:
        result *= n
        n -= 1  # Decrement n to avoid an infinite loop
    return result
Expected Output: The script should print the factorial of the input number.
1. Debugging - Python Arguments
Objective: Correct the code to ensure it prints only the arguments without the Python file name.

Issue:
The current implementation prints all arguments including the script name.

Fix:
python
Copier le code
for i in range(1, len(sys.argv)):  # Start from index 1 to exclude the script name
    print(sys.argv[i])
Expected Output: Only the arguments provided by the user should be printed, excluding the script name.
2. Debugging - HTML / Javascript
Objective: Correct the JavaScript code to change the background color when the button is clicked.

Issue:
The button's ID is incorrectly named "colorButon" instead of "colorButton", which causes the event listener to fail.

Fix:
html
Copier le code
<button id="colorButton">Change Color</button> <!-- Corrected the ID -->
<script>
    document.getElementById("colorButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
        changeBackgroundColor();
    });
</script>
Expected Output: When the button is clicked, the background color of the page should change.
3. Debugging - Python Mines
Objective: Implement a mechanism to detect when all non-mine cells have been revealed to declare a win.

Issue:
The game doesn't have a condition to check when the user has revealed all non-mine cells.

Fix:
python
Copier le code
def check_victory(self):
    for y in range(self.height):
        for x in range(self.width):
            if (y * self.width + x) not in self.mines and not self.revealed[y][x]:
                return False
    return True

def play(self):
    while True:
        self.print_board()
        # User input and game continuation code...
        if self.check_victory():
            print("Congratulations! You've won the game.")
            break
Expected Output: When all non-mine cells are revealed, a victory message should be displayed.
4. Documentation - Python Factorial
Objective: Add appropriate comments to document the code.

Fix:
python
Copier le code
def factorial(n):
    """
    Function to calculate the factorial of a number.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
    int: The factorial of the input number.
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
Expected Output: Comments should be added to explain the function, its parameters, and the return value.
5. Error Handling - Python Checkbook
Objective: Add error handling to prevent the program from crashing when invalid input is provided.

Issue:
The program crashes when a non-numeric value is entered for deposit or withdrawal.

Fix:
python
Copier le code
def main():
    cb = Checkbook()
    while True:
        action = input("What would you like to do? (deposit, withdraw, balance, exit): ")
        if action.lower() == 'exit':
            break
        elif action.lower() == 'deposit':
            try:
                amount = float(input("Enter the amount to deposit: $"))
                cb.deposit(amount)
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input! Please enter a numeric value.")
        elif action.lower() == 'withdraw':
            try:
                amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: $"))
                cb.withdraw(amount)
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input! Please enter a numeric value.")
        elif action.lower() == 'balance':
            cb.get_balance()
        else:
            print("Invalid command. Please try again.")
Expected Output: The program should handle invalid numeric inputs gracefully without crashing.
6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python
Objective: Fix the errors and improve the game functionality.

Issue:
The game has logic errors such as announcing the winner after the last move by the losing player and missing input validation.

Fix:
python
Copier le code
def tic_tac_toe():
    board = [[" "]*3 for _ in range(3)]
    player = "X"
    while not check_winner(board):
        print_board(board)
        try:
            row = int(input("Enter row (0, 1, or 2) for player " + player + ": "))
            col = int(input("Enter column (0, 1, or 2) for player " + player + ": "))
            if 0 <= row <= 2 and 0 <= col <= 2:
                if board[row][col] == " ":
                    board[row][col] = player
                    if check_winner(board):
                        print_board(board)
                        print(f"Player {player} wins!")
                        break
                    player = "O" if player == "X" else "X"
                else:
                    print("That spot is already taken! Try again.")
            else:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter a row and column between 0 and 2.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.")
Expected Output: The game should validate inputs and correctly announce the winner.
